##Key Takeaways

From this exercise, I learned and practiced the following:

* **Pure HTML & CSS Mastery:** Building a responsive website from scratch without relying on frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind allowed me to understand the core principles of the box model, positioning, and layout.
* **Modern CSS Features:** I implemented **CSS Scroll-Driven Animations** (`animation-timeline`) to create dynamic reveal effects without using any JavaScript, leveraging the latest browser capabilities.
* **Flexbox Layouts:** I utilized Flexbox for aligning navigation bars, project cards, and ensuring the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
* **Responsive Design:** I learned how to use Media Queries to ensure the portfolio looks good on both desktop and mobile devices, specifically adjusting the navigation and flex directions for smaller screens.
* **Asset Management:** I practiced organizing project files by separating styles into `style.css` and keeping images in a dedicated `assets` directory for a cleaner project structure.
